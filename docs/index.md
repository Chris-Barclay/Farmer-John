Farmer John is getting too old and achy to be working on his farm all day everyday. He wanted to hire some farmworkers, but we convinced him that our team could build an AI agent that could easily help him on his farm and for much cheaper than conventional labor. Farmer John wants us to make an AI agent that can plant and harvest wheat, carrots, and potatoes for him. This means we will need to teach our AI farmer to navigate around Farmer John's farm and how to best maintain the farm in order to guarantee the highest possible crop yield.
